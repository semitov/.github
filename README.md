SemiTO-V is an upcoming student team at [Polytechnic University of Turin](https://www.polito.it/en) that uses open
standard [RISC-V ISA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RISC-V) based cores to create custom processors, firmware, and
software as well as our own PCB designs (for our own processors and ready ones). Weâ€™re mastering everything from
circuit analysis to processor architecture, and from RTL design to low-level software development for RISC-V ISA 
(RV32 and potentially RV64).

Check out [about us page](https://semitov.github.io/about) and [projects page](https://semitov.github.io/projects) to learn more about our work. Check [team page](https://semitov.github.io/team) to see the people that are behind SemiTO-V.
